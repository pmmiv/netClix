# Netclix
## A memory game

by PM Milam IV

### Purpose:

This project was created to experiment with React JS and JSX. The end result is a memory game based around Netflix Originals. I'd like to revisit the site to include user validation to persist top score, add titles to keep the games fresh, change the hover styling for the show card and curve the Netclix title to resemble Netflix.

## Deployment:

This project is available at http://netclix.herokuapp.com

### Notable Technologies Used: 

- React JS
- Javascript
- HTML 5
- CSS 3

### Inspirational Quote:
> All I do is sit at home and watch Netflix
